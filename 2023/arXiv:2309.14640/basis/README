- AO basis functions are in "gth-cc-pvxz.dat":
	- For H, O, and Al, these are taken from

		https://github.com/hongzhouye/ccgto

	- For Ti, correlated consistent basis sets were generated in the same
	spirit.

	- Tutorials on using these basis functions in PySCF and CP2K are provided
	here:

- Fitting basis functions are in "gth-cc-pvxz-fit.dat". We only generated
fitting functions for H, O, and Ti in this work.


================

- For Al2O3+water, we used the even-temperared basis functions (ETB) generated
automatically by PySCF as the fitting basis. This can be done by initializing
the Cell object with the customized AO basis sets from above and then

	kmf = scf.KRHF(cell, kpts).rs_density_fit()

or

	kmf = scf.KRHF(cell, kpts).rs_density_fit(auxbasis=None)

- For TiO2+water, we use the optimized fitting functions mentioned above by
first loading them in the same way as to load the AO basis (see tutorials
above) and then

	kmf = scf.KRHF(cell, kpts).rs_density_fit(auxbasis=auxbasis)
